## To plugin users
Hello,

Sorry that the plugin didnâ€™t work well for all of you. Unfortunately, I donâ€™t have testing devices and time for investigations and fixing issues at the moment. Please feel free to create new tickets. I would be even more grateful for pull requests.
Iâ€™m not abandoning the plugin and promise to merge contributions with fixes and new functionality, hence I would kindly ask for help with the development ðŸ™‚

Thanks in advance!

## Usage

### Import the package
Add to `pubspec.yaml`

The plugin uses the device camera, so do not forget to provide the `NSCameraUsageDescription`. You may specify it in `Info.plist` like that:
```xml
    <key>NSCameraUsageDescription</key>
    <string>May I scan a MRZ please?</string>
```

### For Android
Add
```
<uses-permission android:name="android.permission.CAMERA" />
```
to `AndroidManifest.xml`

### Use the widget
Use `MRZScanner` widget:
```dart
MRZScanner(
  withOverlay: true, // optional overlay
  onControllerCreated: (controller) =>
    onControllerCreated(controller),
  )
```
Refer to `example` project for the complete app sample.
